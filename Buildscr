# Build the Pocket PC binaries and CAB.
#
# NOTE: This part of the build script requires the Windows delegate
# server to have the cabwiz program on its PATH. This will
# typically be at
#
#   C:\Program Files\Windows CE Tools\WCE420\POCKET PC 2003\Tools
#
# but it might not be if you've installed it somewhere else, or
# have a different version.
#
# NOTE ALSO: This part of the build is commented out, for the
# moment, because cabwiz does unhelpful things when run from within
# a bob delegate process (or, more generally, when run from any
# terminal-based remote login to a Windows machine, including
# Cygwin opensshd and Windows Telnet). The symptom is that cabwiz
# just beeps and sits there. Until I figure out how to build the
# .cab from an automated process (and I'm willing to consider silly
# approaches such as a third-party CAB generator), I don't think I
# can sensibly enable this build.
